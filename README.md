# Data401 final project
This project runs an Extract-Transform-Load data pipeline, built in Python. The data consists of various types of information files that are stored in an AWS S3 bucket. The files are in .csv, JSON or .txt format, and contain info about potential and current students at the Sparta Academy. The code uses object-oriented programming, creating classes to inspect the files in S3, read to memory, clean and format the data as required, and load into MongoAtlas, a NoSQL database.
